# Introduction

Greetings traveler! I'm deathbyknowledge **aka** dbk, a software engineer going down the infosec rabbit-hole.

## *What can you find here, you ask?*

Before I get into that, have I told you I'm socially awkward when it comes to putting stuff on the internet? No? Well, bet your ass I am. I've never tweeted a single line nor uploaded a picture on instagram. My reasoning has always been something between the lines of "Who tf cares about what I have to say?" or "No one is going to see it anyway". Don't get me wrong, I don't want you to feel pity. I truly don't ~~give a fuck~~ care.

**BUT HERE WE ARE!!**
Yes yes, I know what I just said but I also mentioned the magical place of _infosec_. Everytime I'm trying a new HTB box, learning a new tool, implementing some paper or just playing on my own there's **always** someone's blog (known or unknown) that comes in handy. Be it to get the grasp of a new concept or completing some challenge, someone in the other side of the world is giving away free knowledge through what youngsters call "the internets".

With that said, this blog is my humble attempt at it. Stepping out of my comfort zone to post, every now and then, stuff I might be playing with that might be helpful to someone, somewhere,  at some point.


Thank you for coming to my TED Talk,

PS: In case you were going to leave unhappy, I'll add a picture of my dog to try and change that

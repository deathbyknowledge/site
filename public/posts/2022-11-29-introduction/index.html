<p>Greetings traveler! I&rsquo;m deathbyknowledge <strong>aka</strong> dbk, a software engineer going down the infosec rabbit-hole.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-you-find-here-you-ask"><em>What can you find here, you ask?</em></h2>
<p>Before I get into that, have I told you I&rsquo;m socially awkward when it comes to putting stuff on the internet? No? Well, bet your ass I am. I&rsquo;ve never tweeted a single line nor uploaded a picture on instagram. My reasoning has always been something between the lines of &ldquo;Who tf cares about what I have to say?&rdquo; or &ldquo;No one is going to see it anyway&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&rsquo;t want you to feel pity. I truly don&rsquo;t <del>give a fuck</del> care.</p>
<p><strong>BUT HERE WE ARE!!</strong>
Yes yes, I know what I just said but I also mentioned the magical place of <em>infosec</em>. Everytime I&rsquo;m trying a new HTB box, learning a new tool, implementing some paper or just playing on my own there&rsquo;s <strong>always</strong> someone&rsquo;s blog (known or unknown) that comes in handy. Be it to get the grasp of a new concept or completing some challenge, someone in the other side of the world is giving away free knowledge through what youngsters call &ldquo;the internets&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With that said, this blog is my humble attempt at it. Stepping out of my comfort zone to post, every now and then, stuff I might be playing with that might be helpful to someone, somewhere,  at some point.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my TED Talk,
<br>
dbk</p>
<p>PS: In case you were going to leave unhappy, I&rsquo;ll add a picture of my dog to try and change that</p>
